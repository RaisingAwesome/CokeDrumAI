**Educators**
I must admit, this is one of the more challenging builds.  Not because the card does not have good capabilities, mainly because it takes a lot of code 
to pull off.  In addition, you will take on some charges after your Free Trail for Microsoft Azure's services is over.  So, you have to be careful in that department.


**Makers**
So, if you are a maker who just wants to explore cloud based syncronyzation and get an I2C, analog read, and Soft PWM project on the Azure Sphere - you've come to the right place.

Copy down this code and then follow this blog to get your own Azure Sphere starter kit going:

To get the DarkSky.net working, you need to create your own account.  I've commented it out for now since you need to update your own "secrets"
