## Educators

I must admit, this is one of the more challenging builds.  Not because the card does not have good capabilities, but rather because it takes a lot of code to pull off a small project.  In addition, you will take on some financial charges after your Free Trail for Microsoft Azure's services is over.  So, you have to be careful in that department.


## Makers

So, if you are a maker who just wants to explore cloud based data storage and get an I2C, analog read, and Soft PWM project on the Azure Sphere - you've come to the right place.

Copy down this code and then follow this blog to get your own Azure Sphere starter kit going:

To get the DarkSky.net working, you need to create your own account.  I've commented it out for now since you need to update your own "secrets"

Note:  the ADC is still in Beta, my code traps for its anomolies it presents.
